# Personal Blog

## Description
The motivation behind this project was to learn how to ulitize web APIs and gain a deeper understanding of locale storage. This project was built with th idea of being able to use and built a web site using the locale storage to get objects and store objects. It was able to solve the issue of learning how to use the locale storage and using JSON to store the objects into the locale array. I was able to learn how locale storage works, how store objects within the locale storage and retrieve them.
